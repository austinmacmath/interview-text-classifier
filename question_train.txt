They didn't seem happy with my answer of ""I choose the easiest thing to implement first"" and carried on trying to wrangle a more data scientist-y answer like ""A decision tree seemed to mathematically fit the feature space better""  which is fine if you want to make sure people understand model basics then ask it directly rather than try to direct them into a weird  non-truthful narrative of what happened on the job. In person  3 hour interview all on model specifics. Asked a lot about maths. I think these are all fine  depending on the role you're applying for. Personally  I'm more of a full stack DS person and by focusing so much on the models and the maths behind the models  it was an odd interview for a role that I assume ultimately was applied DS rather than research DS. Or maybe it truly was a research based role and the questions were appropriate. The fact that I still can't tell says a lot about how unclear the role description was and about the confusion from the hiring manager about what they wanted. That's a red flag."
