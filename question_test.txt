That's what Equal Opportunity Employer means. I guess Dell does not comply with the federal labor regulation. Then one of my former coworker who is a U.S. citizen told me that he applied for a Process Engineer position at Dell and the manager told him that  within a week they received 2 000 applications and most of them are from India. He then told me because most engineering jobs at Dell are occupied by Indian people who refer their Indian friends for engineering jobs at Dell every day. He also said  if you are not Indian  it is most likely you will not get an engineering job interview  not to mention a job offer. Apparently he is right because I am not Indian and my job interview with Dell was not real. I was used for them to test the market and benefit their green card process. There is no diversity at Dell engineering department. 99% of their engineers are Indian even though they website advocates diversity in their corporate culture. It was just a joke.

We had a short discussion during which I asked him if he had followed any of the links on my one-page resume; (I had links to my LinkedIn profile and my professional website.) He hadn't. The two sites contained  in total  at least a dozen examples of my work. I asked him if he knew what the hiring manager wanted and he did not. I told him that I'd have to think about it for a while and send him some examples to take to the hiring manager. After a few minutes of thought  I came to the conclusion that it would be another waste of my time.
