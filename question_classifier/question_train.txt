__label__1  Assume you have a loyalty rewards program  where every user who makes purchase earns 200% of their order amount as reward points and when users return the item - the 200% points based on the current price of the product are deducted. We suspect some users have realized a gateway where they buy the product at full price but return when it is at discounted price so they keep the net difference in points (the refund always refunds full order amount). If user does this accidently or if the impact is less than 5000 reward points then business wants to ignore but identify anyone who is abusing this - how will you identify such users based on last 6 months of order and refund data.

__label__1  Show on the whiteboard how you would design an alarm system. This was a sufficiently vague question that any interviewer can interpret the answer however he seems fit. Moreover  the interviewer seemed to want me to think about it in terms of Java architecture and concurrency. I would've preferred being given a programming question.
__label__1  Classic stuff about your experience and some examples of relevant projects (for the phone interview) maybe a little bit of model stuff like why you chose specific models. They didn't seem happy with my answer of I choose the easiest thing to implement first and carried on trying to wrangle a more data scientist-y answer like A decision tree seemed to mathematically fit the feature space better  which is fine if you want to make sure people understand model basics then ask it directly rather than try to direct them into a weird  non-truthful narrative of what happened on the job. In person  3 hour interview all on model specifics. Asked a lot about maths. I think these are all fine  depending on the role you're applying for. Personally  I'm more of a full stack DS person and by focusing so much on the models and the maths behind the models  it was an odd interview for a role that I assume ultimately was applied DS rather than research DS. Or maybe it truly was a research based role and the questions were appropriate. The fact that I still can't tell says a lot about how unclear the role description was and about the confusion from the hiring manager about what they wanted. That's a red flag.

__label__1  The structure of the Interview was schedule like 1) HR Screening 2) Technical Screening ( Python code to show randomness - Flipping a coin  dice  random ball selection  etc. Solved using Bayesian statistics) 3) Behavioral and technical round  this was 5 hours with different persons. Includes again a coding challenge. Given a text  how to convert to int and do calculations or anagram type of questions( I did successfully completed but the interviewer was having an eagle eye on my keyboard which made me not comfortable). Followed by analytical questions based on resume and experience. The third round was mostly related to entity relationship followed by the fourth round looking for leadership skills and lastly a demo of what Komodo product looks like. My advice to Management: First get to know what you need  which skills you need for the data scientist  as a startup company do not expect candidates to be experts at all the available software in the market. The only talent for data scientist you need to look is logics and creativity which could be applied to various tools and techniques.
