If a U.S. citizen or permanent resident is qualified for the job then he or she should be hired, whether they want to apply for green card for their existing employee or not. That's what Equal Opportunity Employer means. I guess Dell does not comply with the federal labor regulation. Then one of my former coworker who is a U.S. citizen told me that he applied for a Process Engineer position at Dell and the manager told him that, within a week they received 2,000 applications and most of them are from India. He then told me because most engineering jobs at Dell are occupied by Indian people who refer their Indian friends for engineering jobs at Dell every day. He also said, if you are not Indian, it is most likely you will not get an engineering job interview, not to mention a job offer. Apparently he is right because I am not Indian and my job interview with Dell was not real. I was used for them to test the market and benefit their green card process. There is no diversity at Dell engineering department. 99% of their engineers are Indian even though they website advocates diversity in their corporate culture. It was just a joke. Also if you get rejected by Dell for one position then you will get rejected for any other position you apply afterwards, even though their rejection email says they encourage you to check out Dell career website frequently as new positions come up blah blah....

Assuming independence, we get: P(lazy | G_1, G_2, G_3) = P(G_1, G_2, G_3 | lazy) * P(lazy) / P(G_1, G_2, G_3) =&gt; P(lazy | G_1, G_2, G_3) = 1 * (0.2) / ( P(careful) * (0.6)^3 + P(lazy) *(1)^3 ) = (0.2) / [0.8 *(0.216) + 0.2] = (0.2) / (0.3728) ~ 0.5364 c. Generalize this for n ads. Again using independence, we have: P(lazy | G_1, ... , G_n) = ... = (0.2) / [(0.8)*(0.6)^n + (1)*(0.2)] = ... = 1/ [4 *(0.6)^n + 1 ] d. Classify a rater as careful or lazy using this information: Consider some rater and n ratings logged by that rater. If n is sufficiently large, we know that the sample proportion of 'good' ratings can be approximated by the normal dist. N(np, sqrt(p(1-p)/n)). We have n and p, so we can exactly determine this distribution.

I mentioned that as a performance engineer, among the things i have to do is populated the databases with large quantities of data so that SQL queries would be against tables with completely filled with data. Sometimes that was just test data, sometimes it was real data that came from other sources. I may use Java, Linux Shell Scripts, PL/SQL or some other tool to manipulate the data into the proper format. Although I don\'t call this ""Data Engineering"" i believe it is effectively the same thing. But this was not my primary job, it was a precondition to doing my primary job. I also mentioned that i have a friend whose family owns a business that gets a data feed from a vendor. They needed to continuously get that data into their database. In Python, I wrote the process to parse the incoming data and transform it into the proper format to get it into the companies database. Drilling Info seems to primarily use Python, but when i do my work, Python is just one of many tools i might use. I said that since it was listed in their job posting i downloaded and installed a developer version of SQLServer, SSIS, SSDT and went through a ""how to create your first package"" tutorial, which was pretty easy and not very realistic. So i then tried to re-implement the work I did for my friend\'s company. The work to several days but taught me a LOT more about how SSIS actually works.

In person, 3 hour interview all on model specifics. Asked a lot about maths. I think these are all fine, depending on the role you're applying for. Personally, I'm more of a full stack DS person and by focusing so much on the models and the maths behind the models, it was an odd interview for a role that I assume ultimately was applied DS rather than research DS. Or maybe it truly was a research based role and the questions were appropriate.
