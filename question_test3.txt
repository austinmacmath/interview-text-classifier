If a U.S. citizen or permanent resident is qualified for the job then he or she should be hired  whether they want to apply for green card for their existing employee or not. That's what Equal Opportunity Employer means. I guess Dell does not comply with the federal labor regulation. Then one of my former coworker who is a U.S. citizen told me that he applied for a Process Engineer position at Dell and the manager told him that  within a week they received 2 000 applications and most of them are from India. He then told me because most engineering jobs at Dell are occupied by Indian people who refer their Indian friends for engineering jobs at Dell every day. He also said  if you are not Indian  it is most likely you will not get an engineering job interview  not to mention a job offer. Apparently he is right because I am not Indian and my job interview with Dell was not real. I was used for them to test the market and benefit their green card process. There is no diversity at Dell engineering department. 99% of their engineers are Indian even though they website advocates diversity in their corporate culture. It was just a joke. Also if you get rejected by Dell for one position then you will get rejected for any other position you apply afterwards  even though their rejection email says they encourage you to check out Dell career website frequently as new positions come up blah blah.... Trust me  I tried that.

__label__0  After the usual preliminaries  he asked something like  have you worked (or can you work) with big data. I said yes and asked him what he meant by big data. He didn't know. I asked him if Ingram was really looking for a Data Analyst or did they need a ETL Guy  to collect  clean and format the data. No idea. We had a short discussion during which I asked him if he had followed any of the links on my one-page resume; (I had links to my LinkedIn profile and my professional website.) He hadn't. The two sites contained  in total  at least a dozen examples of my work. I asked him if he knew what the hiring manager wanted and he did not. I told him that I'd have to think about it for a while and send him some examples to take to the hiring manager. After a few minutes of thought  I came to the conclusion that it would be another waste of my time. I sent him an email  thanking him for his time and stating that I was no longer interested in Ingram Micro.

Of the first three phone/live-coding interviews  I was asked to do a merge sort. I guess I understand that they want to make sure I can code. But there's got to be a better problem. The many in-person interviews were (1) 1.5 hour coding-by-myself on a laptop  (2) describe a problem you worked on in detail  (3) NLP interview that didn't focus on NLP  instead they focused on AB testing (which is fine)  (4) Lunch interview  (5) culture fit interview  (6) follow up/close/discussion interview. To be honest  I don't remember much near the end. I think I went directly home after and slept for 12 hours.
